	Functions
Unknown32 - Likely also affects particle systems, similar to InstantiateParticleEff
Unknown612 - Likely deals with instantiating 3D "slash effects" that aren't particle based.


Unknown830, 882, 894, 842, 790, 902, 937, and 995 - Used in wallbounces and/or "wallslides" 

Unknown1657, 1658 - Prevents chain cancels on hit/or whiff, not sure which is which.

enableWhiffCancel() - turns on or off the ability to whiff cancel moves. 1 turns on, 0 turns off. Due to the wide buffer system, this feels like a wider window than it usually is. Used in conjunction with other functions, because even when on you can't whiff cancel into special moves or other gatling moves.

cancel_onhitorblock_() - turns on or off the ability to cancel on hit or block.

ChangeAtkDirection(i) - Overrides whether a move would otherwise hit mid, low, or overhead. For i,0 is Mid, 1 is Overhead and 2 is low. Every attack comes with built in atkDirection, so we'll likely have to override everything to make this work. Place inside Upon_Immediate() for best results. 

storeValue(w,x,y,z) - 
W is
X is the SLOT_# to store it in.
Y is
Z is the value to store in the slot.

Sprite - loads the next frame of animation, the duration the animation stays that way, and advances the function clock by that many frames for that character's animation. Essentially, when this is called, act as if the animation moved forward that many frames. Everything beneath them before the next Sprite call happens on that frame. If duration is longer than 1 and there's additional code, it will begin on the first frame and continue to be active for all frames.

damage1 - Overrides damage value of what the attack would usually be when called during another state/subroutine.

airHitPushbackX(or Y) - overrides air pushback value of what the attack would usually be when called during another state/subroutine.

makeActive - turns on hitboxes, or reactivates already triggered hitboxes, beginning from the last sprite call.
beginRecovery - turns off hitboxes.


physicsImpulseX(or Y) - overrides character normal movement in order to move the given character in specific directions. Positive is up and forward(relative) respectively.

Unknown3 - Likely has to do with state changes, looping, or animations ending
Unknown2077 - Likely Activates Camera Shake at that frame, and for that number of frames afterwords.
Unknown717 - Another function that camera shakes(on hit only?)

Unknown1662 - Likely allows for cancels that wouldn't otherwise be possible to occur or some other factor when it comes to those moves.
Unknown448 - Likely Activates wind effect for all BG stage props affected by it.

move_input() - probably used inside of RoundInit to distinguish required inputs.
	69 	I think is crouching on ground
	68 	I think is Crouching in Air
	77	I think is standing
	22	I think is Heavy
	13	I think is Medium
	4	I think is Light
	31	I think is Special
	172	I think is QCF
	174	I think is QCB
	63	Might be required for KMHA angling
	141	Might be required for KMHA angling
	273	Might be required for KMHA angling
	147	Might be required for KMHA angling
Move_state() - Likely the required state the character must be in to use the move in question
	1	I think is Grounded
	3	I think is in Air

	Subroutines
'cmnSpecialAttackExInit' - Likely pulls meter from character when they start an EX move. Common, so it's also likely stored somewhere besides the character files.

'cmnRendaChain_Clear_Idling' - Probably ends the gatling string as if you had returned to idle.

	Misc
Attacks that are considered a certain state have their level and most of their statistics wrapped up 
into "callSuboutine(cmn****ATTACKNAMEHERE****_atkInit)", giving them standard state properties.

storeValue(2,46,0,1) - likely prevents more than one smash attack per combo
storeValue(2,3,0,1) - likely prevents more than one groundbounce per combo

upon_43() - seems to be upon being hit by the opponent.
upon_89() - seems to check if a smash attack/cinematic attack is available.
upon_90() - has something to do with autocombo renda followups. For instance, cell being able to super by just pressing Y at the end of a medium autocombo
upon_49() - either if you have a downward hard smash available, or for light air autocombo stuff. Likely the former.
upon_8() - Likely meaning on air hit/block

mikiwame move - Vanish?

Slot_45 - Sparking?

Piccolo's beam has no distinct level to my knowledge and has the same hitstun and blockstun, meaning it either increases in blockstun or in hitstun
Adult Gohan Lightning legs have a large discrepancy between hitstun and blockstun. Likely reduced blockstun, but look into it regardless
Goku Black J.S might have what we're looking for
Android21 j.S might have what we're looking for
Cooler's s.S has some discrepancies with hitstun and blockstun
Goku Black's Slicer Dance super might have what we need.
Any Crumple state move (UI/Master Roshi) will likely work as replacement for what we need.
GT Goku Medium/Heavy QCF might hold the key (its a hitgrab tho)
Tien's Telekinesis might hold the key
Android 16's hell heat assist too.
